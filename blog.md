      Audio deepfakes pose a growing threat to speaker verification systems and digital security. In this article, I share my experience developing WavSpoof, an audio deepfake detection system that combines advanced neural network architectures with specialized audio processing techniques.

    <p>
      From initial research to presenting at AICCoNS 2025, this project has been a fascinating exploration of the intersection between signal processing and deep learning. I'll discuss the challenges we faced and how we overcame them using LCNN, HuBERT, MFCC, and CQT technologies.

    <p>
      During my internship at Dialog Axiata, I had the opportunity to build an HR chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio. This project aimed to streamline employee support by automating responses to common HR queries and integrating with existing systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this article, I'll walk through the development process, from initial planning to deployment, highlighting how Copilot Studio's capabilities can be leveraged to create intelligent conversational interfaces without extensive coding knowledge.

    <h2>Multi-Agent Systems: The Future of AI Collaboration</h2>
    <div class="blog-meta">
      <span class="blog-date"><i class="far fa-calendar-alt"></i> March 12, 2024</span>

    <p>
      Multi-agent systems represent a paradigm shift in how we approach complex AI problems. By designing systems where multiple AI agents collaborate, compete, and communicate, we can tackle challenges that would be difficult for single-agent approaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Based on my experience developing IntelliPM and the Stock Analysis project, I'll explore how frameworks like LangChain and LangGraph enable the creation of sophisticated agent networks, and discuss the architectural patterns that lead to successful multi-agent implementations.
